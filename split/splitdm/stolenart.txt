the yuki pfp which is r34 is stolen from a artist whose name is also in the original image which can be found here : https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/657729372513501187/797852341960572978/26_-_ulnVmA6.jpg
she hasnt credited any original artist whose it was stolen from and i dont think she asked either if she could use it (todo: contact original artist about it)
