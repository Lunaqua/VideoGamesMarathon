she made a claim about us leaking her bot's code because we gave her a proper host (its a very nice dedi too) and she thought that we were going to release the code now to put the proper context here lets talk about that she said that she was off to kill herself and went offline we were talking about giving someone the bot's source so they could continue developing it as like 4000 guilds use it for some shit (i doubt those are real numbers) and we didnt want the bot to just fucking rot and fall apart so we figured we would pass the code onto someone else privately thru a very secure way that no one can access and so that person who it has been lend on could continue developing the bot and making it work for future API versions
